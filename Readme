Its a gamified EMA application. 
PSS4 and PSS10 questionnaires are used to measure stress. 
Recall biasness algorithm is designed to remove the biasness from the users' responses. This application tracks the footstep, location, and screen time of the user 
and shows it to the user whenever they fill in responses. This information is used to reduce the recall biases in the responses.
Gamification elements, i.e., mini-game (jumping through stones), leaderboard, scores, continuous feedback, and progress map etc are used.
